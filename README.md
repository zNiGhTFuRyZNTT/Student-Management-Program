# Student Management

## Introduction
 - this project was made as a practise for SUT(Sharif University of Technology) in C programming language, so it is not fully optimized yet and may be good for educational purpose not fot official use.

---
## How to run
 * Assuming you have gcc already installed, run:
    ```
    gcc students.c && a.exe
    ```
    to run immediately. 
    <br>or:
    ```
    gcc students.c -o output
    ```
    then run:
    ```
    output.exe
    ```

## How to use
 - After running the program, you'll be prompted an arrow menu controllable with arrow up and down keys.
 <br>
    - we have many options:
        - Add student
        - Delete Student
        - Find Student
        - List all students by their Average grade
        - Save to file(Formatted)
        - Load from file(to load properly data must be formatted exactly like we save them)
        - Exit (It was the hardest part and can't be explained in here LOLüòÇ)

---
## NOTES
- The program may not function too fast because as I said it was written for uni practise, If you can make it faster or you have any idea to make it ready for official use, don't forget the `Pull requests`üëôü§∫
